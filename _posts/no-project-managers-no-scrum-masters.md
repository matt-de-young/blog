This post describes an agile alternative to scrum that I have had a lot of success with. This was framework developed collaboratively with a group of 9 people developing products including PCBs, firmware, SaaS platforms, Mobile Apps, & infrastructure as code at ivy GmbH. It's not that scrum doesn't work, but I don't think it allows software development teams to do their best work & for high performing teams a better way is possible. Even when scrum is working at its best it involves a lot of overhead & coordination, at its worst it completely separates people making decisions from the consequences of those decisions. The purest form of the method proposed here is to just get a bunch of smart people together & unleash them on a problem with all the context that they need. If your team has already reached that level of enlightenment there is no need to mess around with this method. But this method attempts to work as a recipe to make the magic repeatable.

I want to note here at the top that this is a radical strategy & a departure from the seemingly industry standard practice of having a product manager decide what to do & then hand it off for developers do it. This framework revolves around getting information & context to as many relevant people as possible, trusting that it can only improve solutions & decision making. I would have called this method the anarcho-syndicalist method if I didn't think it would make me effectively unemployable by anyone with a business degree. At ivy we still had product managers but they are completely a part of the team the same way designers or QA testers are in some teams.

## Why

The wide range of talents & experience at ivy allowed for truly innovative solutions, but also presents a problem in that not every team member is interchangeable. In the end I think that is true of every team, but maybe not as pronounced as in this one. Because of the extreme vertical integration, we also had the unique problem of having almost as many products as we had people, which rules out the product based teams approach commonly seen in bigger organizations & why I think this framework is better suited to small, efficient teams with ambitious goals. After adopting this method, we delivered 90% of our projects at or before the target date & most unfinished projects were canceled after only a week or two.

At ivy we were consistently struggling to organize our work into manageable, predictable chunks while still maintaining a consistent direction over the long run. Being a small startup, and it being 2023, waterfall was naturally out. In the beginning we started with scrum, which I still recommend for new & especially inexperienced teams as it is familiar & promises a minimum amount of progress towards goals at a predictable cadence. But the problems, at lest in environments like ours, became very clear very quickly.

When priorities & strategy can change from sprint to sprint, it is hard to actually finish anything, there is no follow through on any new features released. There is also an enormous overhead involved in making sure issues are ready to be put into a cycle, especially if your team has more ideas than time. It is common in startups for priorities to quickly; meaning the chances of any written issue ever being scheduled in a sprint are around 50%.

Context switching can really inhibit a developers productivity & should be avoided as much as possible. Another way to think of the method described below is an evolution on the idea of sprint goals which tries to keep issues in a sprint cohesive; but it is all to common for a team to pick a grab bag of issues & then try to work backwards into a sprint goal. This method ensures that it happens the other way around.

It is an age old problem that one cannot separate the solution from the implementation; writing a solution in an issue must also define the implementation or else it's not a complete solution. Plus, the act of writing the issue to a standard that anyone else can pick it up brings the author an appreciable amount of the way towards actually solving the problem itself; only for that context to be lost when another person picks up the issue or a month passes before it is picked up. This is a general problem in many teams that is worth following up on in a later post as it informs some of our other unorthodox approaches to organizing work.

The last problem scrum teams face is finding out which issues would be more impactful together than alone & so should either all be accepted or none should. That's where the first process change came in, projects.

## Projects

It's worth noting at this point that we used Linear to track our issues & the [Linear Method](https://linear.app/method) was a huge influence where it wasn't outright stolen. Linear projects allows teams to pursue a greater purpose than closing as many issues as possible & gives them occasions to celebrate their wins.

At ivy, projects normally had around 3 to 5 members which reduces collaboration overhead & allows those closest to the problem to solve the problem. Each project team was also cross-functional & autonomous. We had guidelines & principles (below), but each team was expected to figure out how to collaborate based on the unique team make up & the problem being solved; teams could decide if they wanted to have a daily standup, pair program, use feature branches, etc.

Projects had a singular lead who was responsible for pitching the idea, managing the project while in progress, reporting it's status to the whole organization, & accepting the responsibility for success or failure of the project. This role could be, & was expected to be at some point, filled by any person with any role in the organization; although naturally more senior members led projects more often.

> [!question] Why have a project lead at all?
> It is expected that the project lead won't rule like a petty dictator, but concentrating decision making can bypass discussions leading nowhere & leaves no where to hide from responsibility for a poorly planed, poorly executed, project.

This rotating leadership position allowed everyone to practice these skills & develops sympathy between those leading & those following. It provides a growth path for senior team members & allows them to try out leadership without having to make a career change. Even if a person has no desire to become a manager, knowing that one likely won't be leading the next project curbs some of a leads worst tendencies that can crop up in software development projects. It also teaches one what a leader expects & what is realistic to expect of a leader.

There is a lot more to how we actually ran projects, we had a whole playbook which I will put up in a separate post. But below is some more information about what happens before a project is started.

## Starting Projects

Projects start as an idea, everyone has ideas, both good & bad. The first step is to write down the basics, about 250 words, including (but not limited to) primary & secondary objectives, background, & known unknowns. A project could be implementing a new feature, a new product, or a specific goal like improving web vitals. They then pitch the idea to the whole org, we might have feedback but at this point it should be as constructive as possible, not focusing too much on if it would provide enough business value.

The goal is to encourage people to have as many ideas as possible & to feel conformable bringing them to the group. An idea might go through several rounds of presenting & feedback, both in meetings & asynchronously before it is considered ready to be accepted as a project. Stakeholders & product managers are especially encouraged to give their feedback on the estimated value of a project at this point. However we try not to spend a lot of time on ideas at this stage as the majority are never turned into projects that actually start.

At the end of every cycle, we will take a look at the team workload, technical debt, SLOs, etc. & decide if we should start a project or not. If yes, we will choose from the list of ideas ready to be worked on. The main way that we do this is that every person has the right to choose if they want to work on a project or not. If the lead does not think they have enough members to accomplish the project within the defined budget, a project will not start. If the lead thinks there are too many people to work efficiently, they can also choose their team.

> [!question] Does this mean people are always working on projects?
> No, we also had a backlog of KTLO or small improvement tasks. If someone isn't working on a project they will work on those. We tried to keep at least one person in that role at all times as they would also provide support & act as a first responder to any bugs.

It's very important to note that starting a project is not a commitment to finish it. Project leads are encouraged to find out if a project will provide value or not as soon as possible & cancel the project if not. This avoids us spending too much time on projects before they start which is often untracked work & distracts from ongoing projects, decreasing their change of success.

## Budgets

Budgets were another unique process change that helped this recipe work. It's important to understand that a budget is not an estimate; in fact this was in direct response to the inadequacy of estimating software development tasks, which is a whole other blog post in itself. But we were still a business & needed to provide some early warning system that the project is going to take longer than we thought it would, especially since we generally won't do a lot of research before agreeing to start a project.

Having a budget when the project starts allowed us to meet our business needs of not costing more to develop a product or feature than we think we can make back in revenue. It also constrains the ideas which are considered as viable options when a project team is making a plan, helping to avoid decision paralysis.

Setting a project budget is the hardest thing about implementing this framework successfully. Some analysis on the value derived from a project should be done before it is started, & then recorded in the project spec so that it can be referenced when making decisions & determining if a project was successful or not. The team must really work hard here to avoid falling into estimates; not accounting for anything unexpected occurring in the project & thus accepting a project with thin margins is a recipe for a net loss. Setting the budget at a break even point means that the team has put all their eggs into one basket & will have no ability to change direction once a project is started.

> [!important] This seems to be the only downside to this approach; it puts a lot of speculative effort onto the business side before a project starts while most organizations are used to putting that effort onto developers in the form of estimates.

One would think that the higher the budget, the more likely a project is to end successfully, but there is a bit of a paradox here. Having too large of a budget can lead to a lack of direction & the larger a task is, the harder it is to estimate due to the amount of surprises. Shipping early & often helps to mitigate this as having something is better than nothing & this helps to uncover the unknown unknowns early. Starting with the most complex problems first allows the team to make decisions with the most uncertainty out of the way.

Milestones are decided early on & are used to track the progress of a project, examples are "Beta release" or "API complete". Missing a milestone should be occasion to change direction or even cancel the project. Increasing the budget is another option, but is generally the last resort to avoid slipping into the sunk-cost fallacy. At ivy we had even gone as far as to cancel a project just to start another one shortly after with the same goals but a different plan. After all, if a project is canceled early enough then the time spent isn't wasted, it was just spent learning.

If the team manages to meet all of its primary objectives for a project before the budget they can end a project early, but the project team is also encouraged to continue working on the project & producing an even better result. A few home run projects with real follow-through are often all a startup needs to be successful.

## Guidelines

There are basically no rules for how to run projects, but these guidelines have served ivy well & one should have a very good reason for violating any of them.

1. **Don't change project leads.** This just leads to confusion & it never ends well for the same reason that having co-leads of a project is a bad idea.
1. **People are assigned to no more than 1 project per cycle.** This helps us track the amount of effort spent on a project & provides focus.
1. **Projects have more than 1 member.** This prevents information from being lost. There is also a huge benefit to the quality of ideas that can be generated with more people, but diminishing with each additional person making the first addition extremely important.
1. **Don't add or remove members once a project is in progress.** Same as the above but onboarding new people takes time, plus they aren't able to contribute to the project plan.
1. **Tackle any technical debt first.** Just like real debt, paying it off as soon as possible means that you can get the most value from effort spent on the project.
1. **Projects are worked on in consecutive sprints.** This avoids context switching & minimized un-shipped work at any given time.
1. **Projects are a number one priority.** For every member, an in progress project should take priority over any other task or meeting not related to the project

> [!question] What happens if something really urgent comes up while an unrelated project is ongoing?
> This is what the support person is for; hopefully nothing that large & urgent should come out of no where. It's important to let a project finish as it as part of the trust agreement been the project team & the greater business.

## Future

This is likely not the final form that this method will take & the team at ivy will continue to iterate on the idea. But as far as I can tell we have come up with a novel way to organize our work that allows the flexibility for teams to do their best work while providing a framework that allows for measuring success & providing predictable dates. I hope some other teams try this out; if you do, please get in toch & me know how it goes.
